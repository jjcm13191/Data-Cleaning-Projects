In this project I clean a data set containing Female Muscians and their Tours using python.
The objective was to remove duplicants, remove or fill missing values, split data when needed, make sure columns matched if neccesary, and every column was using the correct data type.
#The years column was split into start year and end year
#The total years column was added and filled
#Columns with too many irreplaceable missing values were removed
#No duplicates found
#All columns have the correct data type
#Nothing to match
